The idea behind the app is to help with data cleanup. In one of the projects in class we had<br>
to cleanup a very large file (NOAA File) and one of the features (EVTYPE) that specified the<br>
type of event needed significant cleanup with many equivalent entries written differently<br>
for example. To accomplish such as task in R was possible but itterative and tedious.<br><br>
This app facilitates that text replacement process.<br><br>

1. <b>APP</b> opens "StormDataSubset.csv" (Filename) and filters to EVTYPE (Feature)... See in global.R.<br><br>
2. <b>APP</b> creates 2 tabs with feature labels frequency table "FREQ TABLE" and full data "DATA"".<br><br>
3. <b>APP</b> creates sidebar panel for USER input that can be accessed from both tabs.<br><br>
4. Fisrst, <b>USER</b> can enter text to filter "FREQ TABLE"" labels for ease of review.<br><br>
5. Next, <b>USER</b> can manually choose all target labels for subsequent replacement from selection list.<br><br>
6. <b>USER</b> may also narrow selection to filtered <b>FREQ</b> TABLE list by clicking "From FREQ TABLE" button.<br><br>
7. Once label selection is completed, <b>USER</b> can enter "replacement text".<br><br>
8. If <b>USER</b> presses "Replace" button then <b>APP</b> replaces all selected labels with replacement text.<br><br>
9. The <b>APP</b> then updates <b>DATA</b>, reloads application, and process can begin again.<br><br>
10. Once <b>USER</b> has completed using the <b>APP</b> he/she may download resulting <b>DATA</b>.<br><br>
11. The downloaded file will have all replaced entries and date stamp.<br>
