LabelCleanUp - Developing Data Products

The <b>LabelCleanUp Helper</b> app was built as the final project to the Coursera course Developing Data Products by Johns Hopkins University's <b>Bloomberg School of Public Health</b> as presented by <b>Brian S. Caffo, PhD</b>.<br>

The idea behind the app is to help with data cleanup. In one of the projects in class we had to cleanup a very large file (<b>NOAA File</b>) and one of the features (<b>EVTYPE</b>) that specified the type of event needed significant cleanup with many equivalent entries written differently for example. To accomplish such as task in R was possible but itterative and tedious. This app facilitates that text replacement process.

The <b>LabelCleanUp Helper</b> app is hosted and available at:<br>

The project files are contained within the following <b>Github</b> repository:<br>

The data file <b>StormDataSubset.csv</b> used in this app was a small subset taken from the NOAA Storm Database:<br>
